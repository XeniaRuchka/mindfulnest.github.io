                    <p>Mindfulnest is truly a haven and shopper's heaven of locally made art, sculpture, jewelry, gifts and accessories. Step inside and you are immediately surrounded by the inspired work of almost 100 North American artists and artisans. The store, with its earthy colors, and open beam ceilings will make you feel calm and welcome and the staff will, too.​ Our website is a tiny representation of what is available in the MindfulNest store locations in Burbank, Santa Monica, and Highland Park. In stores, we offer unique, handmade art, jewelry and home decor. We do our best to put new products online, but can't always post as fast as they come in! Email us at MindfulNestHP@gmail.com if you saw a product in a store that you can't find online. We will do our best to see if that item is available to ship to you.

                      <p>Diane Jackson and Amanda Vernon worked together in another artisan environment for over a decade. Spending time together outside of work, they realized that they had a very similar outlook and aesthetic when it came to their "taste" in products and artists, and that they shared the same feelings about what they wanted in a business. The wheels started to turn, they opened a store in Burbank, and those wheels continued turning into their second store in Santa Monica. In 2016, they opened their third location in Highland Park, just east of downtown Los Angeles, California.
